# ZERO

A decentralized, p2p light drawing platform that shares across connected networks.

## Intended Goals

1. To create an open social platform such that authentication is seamless and/or automated (no usernames, passwords, etc.)
2. Limit to canvas drawing and remove text input to both simplify input requirements (no categories, dropdowns, additional fields, etc.) and increase creative flexibility.
3. Allow for the highest number of potential participants (no initial gatekeeping) with the ability to mute posts from specified users locally (affects personal preferences, is not exposed outside to the network).
4. Has the least amount of dependencies, third party libraries and code (could be less but this is the first attempt!)
5. Has to maintain a basic level of security for users (send a PR if you see anything that could be improved)
